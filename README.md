# IMPORTANT NOTICE
This is small project prepared to pass another semester on my University. Some mistakes can be included and some things can be done better. This code is only to give you inspiration and show you my own idea, not to use in commercial solutions.

# Cellular Automata 1D
Small project ready to use in Visual Studio 2017 based on C#. The project gives possibily to check how the automaton works in 1D.

## How it is working?
The project is really simple - contains only two classes. One gives possibily to create a rule, second is responsible for management of rules.

## Man it is really simple. Why you added the project here?
Yes, that is true. However we should think about future of every project (included small university projects) - so it should be the most flexible as it can be. I want to share my idea to create a boilerplate for the algorithm. Maybe someone will be inspired to do it better.

## Does it have GUI?
No, it doesn't. It's a console application, but it doesn't matter. Important is an algorithm.

## Can I use this solution?
You can only get inspiration. I know that some things can be done better, but I pushed this to show you example of a way. Not to give you good solution to copy&paste.
