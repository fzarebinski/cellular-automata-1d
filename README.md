Cellular Automata 1D
=====================
Small C# application created to get a credit on my university. Project has implemented Cellular Automata 1D.

## How it works?
This is simple visualitation in console application, so just compile it and show the result.

Implementation is really flexible, so you can adjust generation in `main` function. In the function you can find declared rule, number of iterations and array length. By default values are (as following) 18, 29 and 80.

## Is it properly implementation?
Yes, but there can be some edge cases where apllication can be crashed.

## Can I use it?
Sure, the code is shared on MIT License. However, **I would be grateful for a star** in the project.

## What has been used to created it?
Software created with love to coding in Cracow.
* IDE: Visual Studio 2017,
* OS: Windows 10.

## Can we talk about the implementation?
Sure. I am open to teach you and make the code clearer, so you can reach the goal.
