# IMPORTANT NOTICE
This is small project prepared to pass another semester on my University. Some mistakes can be included and some things can be done better. This code is only to give you inspiration and show you my own idea, not to use in commercial solutions.

# Cellular Automata 1D
Small project ready to use in Visual Studio 2017 based on C#. The project gives possibily to check how the automaton works in 1D.

## How it is working?
The project is really simple - contains only two classes. One gives possibily to create a rule, second is responsible for management of rules.

## Man it is really simple. Why you added the project here?
Yes, that is true. However we should think about future of every project (included small university projects) - so it should be the most flexible as it can be. I want to share my idea to create a boilerplate for the algorithm. Maybe someone will be inspired to do it better.

## Does it have GUI?
No, it doesn't. It's a console application, but it doesn't matter. Important is an algorithm.

## Can I use this solution?
You can only get inspiration. I know that some things can be done better, but I pushed this to show you example of a way. Not to give you good solution to copy&paste.

Cellular Automata 1D
=====================
Small C# application created to get a credit on my university. Project has implemented Cellular Automata 1D.

## How it works?
This is simple visualitation in console application, so just compile it and show the result.

Implementation is really flexible, so you can adjust generation in `main` function. In the function you can find declared rule, number of iterations and array length. By default values are (as following) 18, 29 and 80.

## Is it properly implementation?
Yes, but there can be some edge cases where apllication can be crashed.

## Can I use it?
Sure, the code is shared on MIT License. However, **I would be grateful for a star** in the project.

## What has been used to created it?
Software created with love to coding in Cracow.
* IDE: Visual Studio 2017,
* OS: Windows 10.

## Can we talk about the implementation?
Sure. I am open to teach you and make the code clearer, so you can reach the goal.
